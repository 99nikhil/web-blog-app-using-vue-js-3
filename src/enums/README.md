## Enums

Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants. Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases. TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

### Naming convention

- Use uppercase letters for your enums - they are global constants which have usable values
- We should use .ts file only for enums
